# PraCo.

### Author: George Njogu

### Project Description

Praco is web application that gives you access to over 1300 workout routines from a public API, ExcerciseDB, that you can do at home and at the gym.
The purpose of the application is to give you an idea of how to properly do a workout without exposing yourself to possible injury because of bad form as it has been the case in many occassions.
The workouts are filtered through target body parts. With a click of a button you get a list of all possible workouts for the specific target body part.
